Firstly see you are in master branch 
create the branch ------------ git checkout -b merge 
 create the file merge.html ------- this is my merge file 
 git add .
 git commit -m "this is my merge file"
 git push origin HEAD
 git switch master 
 change on the same file and on the same line 
 git add . 
 git commit -m "master changes "
 git push origin master

 move to server 

  raise the pr 
  move to button resolve  conflicts 
  accept the both chnages -> mask as resolved -> merge the pull request --> confirm merge 

  move to local 
  git pull origin master 

 now the code was updated
